# Pet-Shop-Website
Here is my attempt at creating a website for a pet shop.
I dont have the images in a folder because i wasnt sure how to link my images once in an images folder yet so you can make those changes if you want.
Im looking to see if theres anything anyone would have done differently so feel free to make changes if necessary.
Also, any advice would be reatly appreciated as this is my first time using github and not too sure of how it works just yet.
Last but not least, thanks :)
